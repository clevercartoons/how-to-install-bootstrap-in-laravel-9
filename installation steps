1- create laravel project
    - composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist l9-bootstrap
    or
    - laravel new l9-bootstrap

    Get inside l9-bootstrap.

    cd l9-bootstrap
  
2-Install Laravel/UI
    Laravel UI is an official library that offers selective or predefined UI components. 
    The laravel/ui package comes with the login and registration scaffolding for 
    React, Vue, jQuery, and Bootstrap layouts.

    Run the command to install Laravel/UI.
    
     composer require laravel/ui

3- Install Bootstrap in Laravel
    We have successfully installed a laravel/ui package using Composer, now in this step, 
    we will understand how to easily install the Bootstrap lastest CSS Framework using the following command.

    Run command to install Bootstrap in Laravel project

    php artisan ui bootstrap

4- Install Bootstrap Auth Scaffolding
    Execute the following command to Install the auth scaffoldings with Bootstrap
    
    php artisan ui bootstrap --auth

    We have successfully installed the bootstrap, and you can make sure by going to resource/js/bootstrap.js. 
    You will see that popper.js and jQuery have been added to the bootstrap’s JavaScript file.
    
5- Install Bootstrap Packages
    Before you install Bootstrap Package, you need to check have installed Node js or not.
    - Run this command in command prompt to check
      # for node
      node -v
      # for npm
      npm -v
    - Install the bootstrap package
      npm install
 6- Compile Assets
    As we can see, resources/sass folder _variables.scss and app.scss files have added along 
    with sass variables and fonts.
  
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito');
    // Variables
    @import 'variables';
    // Bootstrap
    @import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
 
 Now, we have to run the below command for asset compilation.
 
    # for development
    npm run dev

    # for production
    npm run production
 
    The above command compiles CSS and JavaScript files from resources/js and resources/sass folder to the public folder.


    - Automate SASS and JS Changes

    If you are lazy and don’t want to run the npm run dev command every time you make changes in SASS and JS file,
    you should use the following command.

       npm run watch


    It keeps an eye on your files and compiles the code automatically if detects any change made in SASS and JS files.


 
 7- Using Bootstrap in Laravel Blade Template

Now, sass files are complied to single CSS file inside the public folder, and we can define the js and 
CSS path and use the Bootstrap js and CSS in the Laravel blade template.
 </head> 
      <script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
      <link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
 </head>
 <body>
 <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">

            <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="exampleFormControlInput1" class="form-label">Email address</label>
                <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlInput1" placeholder="name@example.com">
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="exampleFormControlTextarea1" class="form-label">Example textarea</label>
                <textarea class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlTextarea1" rows="3"></textarea>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
 </body>
